;; you can do this to any part of the code and you can nest programs inside of programs
;; or you can just not use any programs

;; wrap the code in the program 'HelloWorld'
#program HelloWorld

;; create variable 'x' with a string value
;; you can also omit the immediate assignment and leave the variable to be assigned later
define x as "Hello, Catdog!"

;; print variable 'x' to console
